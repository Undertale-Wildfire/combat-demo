# Undertale Wildfire Combat Demo

This is the full source code for v1.11 of the Undertale Wildfire Combat Demo. It
is provided as-is, to do with as you like. Any future releases will be added
here as separate commits.

## Usage

This project should be used with GameMaker 2024.11. Ensure runtime 2024.11.0.227
is installed - the version the IDE installs by default, 2024.11.0.226, contains
a compiler bug that prevents the game from successfully running.

Documentation for some of the game's internal systems is available in the
`docs/` directory. If more support is needed, contact @pythonb5 on Discord.

Undertale Wildfire's codebase has changed significantly since the Combat Demo's
release. Some of these changes have been backported throughout the many patches
the demo has recieved, but overall, the Combat Demo still uses a heavily
outdated version of the Undertale Wildfire engine. Some things are very
unpolished, difficult to work with, or lacking in necessary features. Some notes
about these deficiencies have been included in the documentation. In the future,
a more up-to-date version of the Undertale Wildfire engine may be released, but
it would take some work to separate from the rest of the game, so I won't make
any guarantees.

## Binaries

All versions of the Combat Demo are accessible via the Undertale Wildfire
website. Replace `v111` in the URL with the desired version. Only v1.11 has
